# Hello non-male? something? And non-femimines. Welcome to my stash
Welcome to my STASH of scripts, one of the most stupiddest repositories on earth. But not really since github is supporting this repo.

My scripts are stupid, don't use these.

LOOK! Look at this module!: [AWESOMEMODULE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UnofficialJay3/Jays-Stash-of-Scripts/refs/heads/main/TheAllInOneModule.lua)
Pretty cool right?

Now look at this UI toolkit module: [JaysUIToolKitModule.lua](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UnofficialJay3/Jays-Stash-of-Scripts/refs/heads/main/JaysUIToolKitModule.lua)

All of these scripts are 99% from me and that 1% was ChatGpt (Sometimes you have to get help ykkk???) and inspiration for making that/this script or something.
I don't care if you steal my code, it's not obfuscated (Maybe a few that are...)

This is a way to show that I am NOT a skiddie. And my epik coding skills.
