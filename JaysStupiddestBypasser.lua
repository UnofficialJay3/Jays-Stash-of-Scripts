HOW IT WOOORKS:
First. USEFUL INFORMATION:
1. The RTL method is having characters that changes the direction of a text to Right to Left instead of the default. Tricks the filter because it's backwards even though it's not!
2. LAL method is Look-ALike method. It swaps characters with similar looking characters to... Ofcourse trick the filter. I'll be honest, this doesn't work. Like at all.
3. This bypasser is very stupid, some stuff doesn't work. But hey, if it can do something then it's forth a little! But anyways use RTL method because it's the best. :D

HOW TO USE:
1. On the top of the gui, you see this textbox? Type your bypassed message here.
2. You can press , to focus on the textbox to bypass messages.
3. The RTL button is the Right to Left method, best method for the bypassin'
4. The LAL button is the look-alike method, not recommended unless you want to be tagging so much.

Also note that THIS IS A INSPARATION FROM ANOTHER SCRIPT! I give 99% credit to https://rscripts.net/script/cookie-bypass-op-chat-bypass-Opr3 for the RTL method.
Thank you @mertylmaz from rscripts for the script (I made it from scratch and the methods from scratch, got the idea not stealing.) and @my_ci from scriptblox for the actual script? Then the other person took it to rscripts?

If rscripts DARE to make this to their own url then... Uhhh. Look inside of url to see the info. :)
